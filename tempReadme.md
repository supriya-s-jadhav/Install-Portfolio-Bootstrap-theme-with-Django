# Personal-Portfolio

Personal-Portfolio is a basic web application to showcase my best work, details about myself and a kick-start to my long term passion for blogging. This project is in alpha phase of the development hence its very basic which is subject to change to a finer version as I keep developing it further.

If you want to learn and develop a basic web application using Django, please refer to my repository [Django-Project](https://github.com/supriya-s-jadhav/Django-Project) which is a good guide to get you started with building a basic web application.
